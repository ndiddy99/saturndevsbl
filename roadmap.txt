Things I need for the demo to be ready:
Title screen
2 levels, each with a boss
music for each level and sound effects
a few different enemy types

tech stuff this would require:
arbitrary text display
cd access for loading levels off the disc and cdda
adding binary output to the image converter and binary reading to the engine
